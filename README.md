## üñ®Ô∏è 3D Printed Housing
The enclosure is thoughtfully designed for easy 3D printing on an **Ender 3** printer. The **STL folder** includes three essential files:
- **Main enclosure**
- **Top panel**
- **Optional rotary encoder knob**

Achieving the perfect fit for the rotary encoder might require some fine-tuning. We recommend adjusting the **print size by 1-2%** up or down and testing multiple versions to ensure an optimal fit.



## ‚ö° Electronics
Most components, such as the **7-segment display** and **rotary encoders**, can be directly connected using their respective PCB pins. However, the **KD-22 switch** and **momentary switch** will require some soldering to function properly.

Below is a user-friendly wiring diagram showing the components laid out as if viewed from behind (inside the case).

### üìå Notes:
- The connections to the **KD-22 switch** are exposed; ensure you use **heat-shrink tubing** or **electrical tape** to insulate them.
- The **Arduino Mega** (at least the model used here) doesn't have enough **VCC** or **GND** pins for every component. Daisy chaining with Dupont connectors isn't ideal. A simple solution is to create **Y-splitters** for better connectivity.
