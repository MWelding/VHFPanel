## üñ®Ô∏è 3D Printed Housing  

The enclosure is thoughtfully designed for easy 3D printing on an **Ender 3** printer. The **STL folder** includes three essential files:  

- **Main enclosure**
- **Top panel**
- **Optional rotary encoder knob**

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">

  <img src="images/knob.png" alt="Rotary Knob" width="300" height="300">
</div>

Achieving the perfect fit for the rotary encoder might require some fine-tuning. We recommend adjusting the **print size by 1-2%** up or down and testing multiple versions to ensure an optimal fit.


## ‚ö° Electronics  

Most components, such as the **7-segment display** and **rotary encoders**, can be directly connected using their respective PCB pins. However, the **KD-22 switch** and **momentary switch** will require some soldering to function properly.

Below is the wiring diagram I created. It's my first time, so apologies if some of the correct conventions aren't followed - please provide feedback to improve this.

The KD-22 switch wiring can be tedious, and the guides I found online were hard to understand. Below is an image of the best one I could find. What I did in my design is bridge the common and LED `-` pins and have the `+` for the LED and switch on two separate pins.

### üìå Notes  

- The connections to the **KD-22 switch** are exposed; ensure you use **heat-shrink tubing** or **electrical tape** to insulate them.
- The **Arduino Mega** (at least the model used here) doesn't have enough **VCC** or **GND** pins for every component. Daisy chaining with Dupont connectors isn't ideal. A simple solution is to create **Y-splitters**.


## ‚öôÔ∏è Mobiflight Setup  

Mobiflight setup is straightforward:  

1. **Load the Arduino Mobiflight Module Config** first.  
2. Then load the **.MCC file**.  

The **.MCC configuration file** is optimized for MSFS 2020. Different bindings may be needed for other simulators.
