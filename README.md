# VHF Panel
Welcome to the VHF Panel project repository! This is my first venture into the world of electronics, and the aim of this project is to streamline communications on the VATSIM network. By integrating MobiFlight, we make it possible to easily tune frequencies while flying, embodying the mantra "aviate, navigate, communicate" â€“ allowing you to achieve two at once.
